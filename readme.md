# React-Indecision App

The Indecision App, at its core is an application that helps you decide which task you should perform from a customizable to-do-list of items. This app was developed during the Udemy course: "The Complete React Web Developer" created by Andrew Mead. During the process of creating this application, I learned the solid fundamentals of React.
